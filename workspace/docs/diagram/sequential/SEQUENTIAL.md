## Sequential

Occasionally, function names may be visible in diagrams. This section of functions in sequence diagrams could be converted into state/activity diagrams, but for the sake of coherence, this part has not been removed from the sequence diagram. This is because it has been requested that other entities be seen alongside the calls. Therefore, we have established our own standard for the Auth sequence diagram and are aware of it. For example, OpenConnect has also used functions specifically and customized in its explanatory sections.

### Shortforms

> For example, in our auth class, we have a method called check that is invoked and repeated at the beginning of all other methods.

> G: Get, P: Post, O: Object, R: Repeater
