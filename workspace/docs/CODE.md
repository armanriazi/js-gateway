# Codes

In the code documentation section, there are two methods available: one can access the embedded code through the following list and insert documentation, which in this case means the documentation is created outside of the code project, i.e., it is done in a separate project.
The other recommended method is to execute the command below. By running this command, the `jsdocs` library will create an output or a folder in the project workspace. This documentation is written by the comment-codes present in the main code, and jsdocs utilizes those comments.
Therefore, currently, there are two templates prepared for documentation, which can be used based on the need or change in documentation strategy, or they can contribute to further completing this section.

```bash
npm run docs
```
